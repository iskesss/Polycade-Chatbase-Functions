-------------------------------
15. Adding ROMs
-------------------------------
Adding ROMs to your Polycade AGS library can be done within the Settings tab of Polycade AGS, or by dragging and dropping the ROM file into the appropriate directory in your polycade\games folder on your PC. See below for both methods.
**Method 1: Adding ROMs from AGS Settings**

2\. Select "Add Games" using the A/Green button 
3\. Navigate to "Select a ROM Type..." and select the platform for the game you'll be adding
4\. Select "Add ROMs." A Windows Explorer window will open
5\. Use your mouse to select the ROM file (or Shift+click to select multiple games) you'd like to add, then click "Add ROMs"
6\. AGS will load with a message "Scanning for games...."
7\. Once completed, AGS will display "Copied X {Platform} ROM" message
  
**Method 2: dropping the ROM file into the appropriate folder**
1\. Open Windows Explorer (WindowsKey + E)  

2\. Navigate to:  

> C:\Users\\[YOURUSERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\polycade\games
3.
Drag your ROMs into the appropriate directory. For example, if you have a ROM for an NES game, you would drop it into the "nes" folder.  

4\. Relaunch Polycade AGS in order to have it pickup the new ROMs.
-------------------------------
16. Adding custom images for games
-------------------------------
Polycade AGS automatically creates game tile images for all games in your library, but if you prefer to create your own, you can follow the instructions below (make sure AGS is closed while making these changes in Windows Explorer):  

1\. Open Windows Explorer (WindowsKey + E)  

2\. Navigate to:  

> C:\Users\\[YOURUSERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\polycade\assets\
3\. Open the folder that corresponds to the ROM’s system (i.e. for a “Super C” ROM, you’d open the “nes” folder)  

4\. Locate the folder that corresponds to the name of the game you would like to add or change the images for
5\. Up to 3 images can be added or changed for any game. The game thumbnail image should be 460x215, and should be a jpg file. Place this into the folder you created, and name the thumbnail file “header.jpg”, "hero.jpg" or "logo.jpg" depending on where in the app you would like your image to appear.
Example Header images:
Example "hero" image:
Example "Logo" image:
6\. The next time you launch the application, AGS should pick up the new image(s) for your ROM.
-------------------------------
17. Adding games from Steam
-------------------------------
Steam is a third party gaming service. If you have a Steam account and have installed games on your hard drive, Polycade AGS will automatically search your machine for these games and load them into the AGS library.
To add a new Steam game to your AGS library, follow these steps:
1\. Exit Polycade AGS
2\. Launch the Steam client by clicking the Start menu and finding the Steam icon.
3\. In the Steam client, find the "Library" section. 
4\. On the left hand side of the Steam client, click the game you want, and then click install. 
5\. When the game has finished installing, launch Polycade AGS again.
Polycade AGS should also automatically download the correct image for your game (although you may have to restart Polycade AGS for the image to show up).
To see a list of Steam games that work well on Polycade, see this article: [Compatible Steam Games](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq#/collection/2973/article/12403)
-------------------------------
18. Removing games from Polycade AGS
-------------------------------
The process of removing games from Polycade AGS depends on the platform:
## ROMS & DRM Free
Removing a ROM from Polycade AGS is the opposite process as adding a ROM: simply remove it from the appropriate directory in your polycade\games folder:  

1\. Open Windows Explorer (WindowsKey + E)  

2\. Navigate to:  

> C:\Users\\[YOURUSERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\polycade\games
3\. Find the appropriate directory. For example, if you have a ROM for an NES game, you would open the "nes" folder.  

4\. Locate the game you wish to remove and Delete it (or move it somewhere else)
5\. Relaunch Polycade AGS in order for it to update
## Steam games
If you Uninstall a game from Steam, it will also be removed from the Polycade AGS library.
-------------------------------
19. What kind of internet support is required?
-------------------------------
Polycade Home does not require an internet connection to function, however we strongly recommend an internet connect in order to download games, play online and receive updates to the Polycade AGS software. We make changes to AGS on a regular basis so to access new functions and fixes, make sure you stay updated with the latest version!
If you plan on streaming video, we would recommend a wired connection and we provide a jack for this, but WiFi is supported and will generally work fine. 
-------------------------------
20. Adding games from GOG
-------------------------------
1\. Log into GOG.com and select “Games” from your account menu.
2\. Select the game you want to install, and then click the “Download Offline Backup Game Installers” link
3\. Download the game and any patches by clicking the links
4\. Once the game installer finishes downloading, click it to run the installer. The installer will ask you if you want to allow it to make changes, click “Yes” for this. Then, select your language and choose “Ok”.
5\. Before clicking the “Install” button, select “Options”
6\. Navigate to the folder:  

> C:\Users\\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\polycade\games\drm-free
**Important!** Before selecting “OK” you must select the “drm-free” folder by clicking on it.
7\. Lastly, click “OK”, read and accept the EULA, then click the **Install** button.
-------------------------------
21. Purchasing games from Polycade AGS Store
-------------------------------
  1. Navigate to the Store tab in Polycade AGS


2\. Navigate to the game you'd like to purchase and Select it using the Green/A button. Select "Add to Cart"
3\. Once the game has been added to your cart, the "Add to Cart" button will be replaced by an option to Checkout. Select this.
4\. Use your Joystick/Dpad to navigate to the "Purchase" button and Select it

9\. Once the download icon is gone, the game has finished installing. Select it with the Green/A button to open the Game details 
10\. Select "Play" to play your newly purchased game! 
-------------------------------
22. How do I create a Polycade account?
-------------------------------
To create your Polycade AGS account, you'll need to scan the QR code in the Polycade AGS interface. To do this, launch the software and then navigate to the Login button on the bottom of the left navigation bar. Once Login is selected, you'll see a QR code. Scan the code with your phone and it will take you to a webpage to create an account on your mobile device.
Please note: Currently, the **Polycade AGS** system is separate from the **www.polycade.com** website. If you've already made a purchase on our website, you would still need to create a separate account in Polycade AGS to purchase games and utilize other AGS account features. 
-------------------------------
23. Redeeming Gift Cards or Store Credit
-------------------------------
Polycade Store Credit or Gift Cards are 6-character alphanumeric codes. Most commonly players obtain these codes by purchase of a Polycade machine. In order to redeem your code, follow the steps laid out in this article: <https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/2972/article/12385> but on step 6 (Tap "Purchase"...) before selecting the Purchase button, instead select the "Add Gift Card" option. 
You will then see a box appear directly above this button. In that box, enter your 6 character code. You will then see text reading "Credit Available" above your total for the total amount of the Gift Card's value. Once you see this, continue by pressing the "Purchase" button. 
If your Gift Card balance cover the entirety of the purchase price, you will see a credit card prompt briefly with a loading icon, but after a few seconds you should be informed that your payment was successful. If your balance was not enough to cover the entirety of the purchase price, you will need to enter a credit or debit card number for the remaining total.
Note that you only need to enter this code 1 time even if you use it across multiple purchases or devices. The balance will be tied to your account, which is associated with the email address you provided to sign up and log in. Whenever you make a game purchase using that account, the price of the games will be deducted from your total Gift Card balance until it is exhausted.
-------------------------------
24. Supported Platforms
-------------------------------
Polycade AGS automatically searches your machine for installed [**Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/) games, and loads them into your browsing interface. 
It's also possible to add DRM-Free games such as those available via:
  1. [GOG](https://www.gog.com/)
  2. [Itch.io](https://itch.io/)


We currently also support emulators for the following retro systems:
  1. Arcade
  2. Atari 2600
  3. Gamecube
  4. Game Boy Advance
  5. Sega Genesis
  6. Sega Master System
  7. Nintendo 64
  8. Nintendo Entertainment System
  9. Super Nintendo
  10. TurboGrafx-16


It's also possible to add emulators or other launch methods, however this is not well documented at this time. See this forum post for more info: <https://forums.polycade.com/d/39-add-additional-emulators-yourself/62>
See here for instructions on adding games: <https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/2973/article/11911>
-------------------------------
25. What are ROMs?
-------------------------------
ROMs are copies of original game files, often from a video game cartridge or from an arcade game's main board.
ROM stands for "read-only memory" and work with Emulators to enable classic games to be run on newer operating systems. 
-------------------------------
26. What's an Emulator?
-------------------------------
An emulator is a piece of software or hardware that emulates, or imitates, a video game console. All Polycades ship with most classic system's emulators pre-installed.  
  
With the right emulators and ROM files, it's possible to play retro games from systems like Nintendo, Sega, and all the best arcade games.
For more information, see this article: <https://www.lifewire.com/video-game-emulators-need-to-know-4687006>
-------------------------------
27. Can I play any game I want?
-------------------------------
All arcade games and most classic games work great on the Polycade. 
For modern games that require an Xbox-style controller, Polycade systems enable players to connect a wireless or wired Xbox compatible controller.
The Polycade software includes our built-in game store (which can be [downloaded here](https://polycade.com/download)), and also enable players to install games from other sources - see here for a list of possibilities: <https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/2973/article/11911>
-------------------------------
28. Does Polycade just play old games?
-------------------------------
Polycade uses a gaming grade PC that can run modern graphics intensive titles like Street Fighter V and Mortal Kombat 11 at 60 FPS with the graphics settings slightly turned down.   
  
For retro titles, Polycade uses standard emulators that are made to replicate the classics accurately!
-------------------------------
29. Adding games

-------------------------------
31. Should I get antivirus software?
-------------------------------
Polycade Home runs Windows 10 and will allow you to use all the functionality of a regular PC. If you plan on visiting and downloading things from unsafe websites, you may want antivirus software.
-------------------------------
32. Compatible Steam Games

Here's a list of our favorite titles that are tested and work perfectly with AGS (only require the D-Pad):
[Official Game List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VMH5FMTJ-rwvh3uELRz1PgLy1k6DljczGKVfjRNRW-4/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
Our aim is to continue to update that list, so if you happen to come across anything that we should add, please let us know [via email (info@polycade.com)](mailto:info@polycade.com) or in the [Community Forum](http://forums.polycade.com)!
-------------------------------
33. Adding Additional Emulators
-------------------------------
Polycade AGS includes MAME & Retroarch by default, automatically installed and configured for you. 
There's two ways to add support for additional retro systems:
  1. If the system you're looking for is supported by Retroarch, this will be the easiest way to add another system. To do this, you'll want to launch the Retroarch executable directly, by navigating to it in Windows Explorer and double clicking the executable. It's located here: C:\Users\\[YOUR USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\polycade\emulators\retroarch\retroarch.exe  
From there, you can add systems (aka "Cores") via the Retroarch UI. [See here for more info](https://www.retroarch.com/?page=cores#:~:text=To%20access%20these%2C%20go%20to,run%20new%20or%20updated%20cores!).
  2. You can also add additional emulators. We don't have a great how-to about this right now, but the process has been detailed in our forums - you can check it out here: <https://forums.polycade.com/d/39-add-additional-emulators-yourself/66>


-------------------------------
34. Removing games
-------------------------------
See here:
https://polycade.com/pages/helphq/#/collection/1257/article/4953
-------------------------------
35. Arcade (MAME) ROM errors
-------------------------------
If you added arcade ROMs to AGS and you're getting errors when attempting to launch them, usually the issue is your ROM is missing files. When the ROM fails to launch, AGS will show you the error which will indicate the names of the files that are missing. The fix is to add the missing files to the zip file of the ROM you are trying to launch. 
-------------------------------
36. Steam Tab Issue
-------------------------------
When you press the "back" button on the control panel, a "tab" is also invoked.
Step 1: Using the trackball, click on the little gear icon shown below.
Settings
  

2: Click on the "Controller Settings" option  

3: Make sure the "Xbox Configuration Support" option is unchecked
-------------------------------
37. Steam stuck on blue screen
-------------------------------
Steam can get stuck on a blue screen when it starts. If this happens, open Windows Explorer and delete this file:
> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config\loginusers.vdf
  
You'll need to login to Steam again, but that will fix the issue!
-------------------------------
38. Redeeming Steam Keys
-------------------------------
This process is simple, and made much easier if you copy and paste the keys (1 at a time). Follow the steps below for each key:
### Big Picture Mode
1\. Go to the "Library" Section in Steam
Library
  

2\. Select the "Activate a Product" option
Activate
  

3\. Copy your key and paste into the text box
Paste
  

4\. Repeat for any other keys you have!
### Standard Mode
Start your Steam client in small picture mode and follow the instructions to activate your Steam code.
1\. Click the button "+ ADD A GAME..." in the bottom left corner of your Steam client.
2\. You must agree with the Subscriber Agreement. Click the "I AGREE" button to proceed.
3\. Insert your Steam key in the field labeled with "Product Code".
4\. Click the "Next" button to activate/redeem your game on Steam.
5\. After you've clicked the "Finish" button you can start the download of the game!
-------------------------------
39. How to fullscreen a game
-------------------------------
Often times, games from Steam or other sources do not default to fullscreen mode. 
  
To fix this, follow these steps:
  1. Launch the game
  2. When you can see the game window, press ALT + ENTER on your keyboard. If the game goes fullscreen, you're done! 
  3. If ALT + ENTER does not cause your game to go fullscreen, then look for the options menu within the game. Somewhere in the game's options will be a fullscreen setting (sometimes this is in a "video options" section within the game options).


Once you set a game to fullscreen mode, it will open that way in the future.
-------------------------------
40. How do I find games on Steam that will work best on Polycade?
-------------------------------
Games on Steam are designed for a variety of control types. Some need a keyboard & mouse to play, some need a controller like an Xbox controller, and others will work on Polycade's arcade controls. 
We have tested a bunch of games and confirmed their compatibility, though this list is far from exhaustive. See our list of tested & recommended titles here: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VMH5FMTJ-rwvh3uELRz1PgLy1k6DljczGKVfjRNRW-4/edit?gid=0#gid=0>
#### Understanding Polycade's Controls
Polycade's controls are recognized by the computer as Xbox controllers, so many games that Steam marks as controller compatible will work on your Polycade - HOWEVER - Polycade's controls do not have the analog joysticks (or their buttons, R3 and L3) found on the Xbox controller, so any games that relies on these joysticks to play will not work. The joysticks on your Polycade are recognized by the computer as the D-Pad on your Xbox controller. 
Sadly, there is no great way to know which Steam games will work on Polycade until you download them. 
If you do end up downloading a game that's controller compatible but relies on the analog joysticks, you can play those games by connecting an XBox controller to your Polycade.
#### What to do if a Steam game's controls don't work
If you wind up purchasing a game from Steam that doesn't work with your available controllers, you can try a few things:
  1. Some games allow you to remap the controls. Check the in-game settings and see if the game supports control remapping. For us, if this option doesn't work, we usually stop here as the next two options can be a bit involved and sometimes cause unexpected effects.
  2. Steam allows you to remap controls per game in the Steam app.
  3. You can use a 3rd party remapper like Xpadder, though this can have unexpected effects on your system.


#### Steam Refunds 
If you can't get a game to work, or you don't enjoy the game for any reason, Steam offers a no-questions-asked refund policy for any game that has been played for **less than 2 hours**. For help with the Steam refund process please see [this article on Steam's website](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/784C-923B-A4A1-C825) for step-by-step instructions on how to request a refund.
-------------------------------
41. Unable to log in, even with scroll function
-------------------------------
Best case is to plug in a real keyboard. 
If that's not an option, you can use the Windows on screen keyboard (the on built into Steam doesn't work). Here's how to open the Windows on screen keyboard: 
1\. Exit Steam
2\. Select “Start Menu” > “Settings“
3\. Choose “Ease of Access“
4\. Select “Keyboard“
5\. Set “On-Screen Keyboard” to “On”
-------------------------------
42. Game list won't scroll
-------------------------------
There's a bug with game selection in Steam big picture where your library of games doesn’t scroll as cursor moves. Here's how to fix it:
-------------------------------
43. How to uninstall Steam games
-------------------------------
Steam games can only be uninstalled via the Steam App while Polycade AGS is closed.
  1. Open Steam
  2. Open "Library" tab


3\. Locate the game you wish to uninstall and right click on it
4\. Select "Manage"
5\. Choose "Uninstall"
6\. On confirmation pop-up, select "Uninstall"
-------------------------------
44. Testing joysticks &amp; buttons
-------------------------------
**Method 1**
1\. On your keyboard, press [WINDOWS LOGO KEY]+R
2\. In the box that pops up, type "joy.cpl" without quotes and press [ENTER] 
3\. If you're using a Polycade Arcade machine, you should see 2x Xbox controllers (or 4x Xbox controllers for the Squadcade).
4\. Double clicking on one of the controllers in the list will allow you to test it to ensure all buttons / joysticks for that controller are responding. If you don't get any response, be sure to try the other set of controls on your Polycade (i.e. the Player 2 joystick & buttons).
If you do not see 2x Xbox controllers, and instead see other types of controllers or no controllers,  __[try this next](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/2975/article/11926).
**Method 2**
1\. Open Devices & Printers. This is most easily done by pressing the Windows key on your keyboard and then typing "control panel". From there, click on "Devices & Printers".
Right click on an Xbox controller and select "Game controller settings"
2\. Select Properties.
3\. Press buttons on your control panel and move the joystick around to verify all are working. This test will only work for ONE side of your control panel (see Step 5 for the other side). Note that pressing the 'home' button will close this properties box.
4\. Close the properties box and then select the other controller in the list (Step 3) and then perform Step 4 for the other side of your control panel.
-------------------------------
45. Controller not working
-------------------------------
### 
### Disconnect and reconnect USB 
Often times simply refreshing the USB connection between your controller and the Polycade computer will fix controller issues.
  
1\. Open the drawer on your Polycade 
2\. Unscrew the 2 thumbscrews located approximately 4-5 inches from the outsides of the panel. NOTES:
  * These feel like little metal knobs that are meant for your fingers. If you find the rubber bumpers with a screw in the middle, you're too far back.
  * If you have a v2 Polycade (v2's have a metal cabinet and no camera above the screen), then there may be 2 additional thumbscrews 6" back from the front two (parallel with the front two. These will be tricky to reach. We recommend unscrewing the back left one first, followed by the back right one, then the front two, as removing each one can make the next one harder to remove.


3\. Pull the control panel out by lifting the front of the panel up and sliding the panel toward you.
4\. Find the USB connection. Disconnect the cable, wait 3 seconds, and reconnect.
If the above didn't resolve your issue, read on.
### Check mode
If you have a Polycade from 2021 or before, you might have a mode problem. Basically, your controller boards have the ability to switch "modes", even though they only work in one mode. You can check the mode by following these steps:
  1. On your keyboard, press WIN+R to open the "Run" box.
  2. Type "joy.cpl" and press enter  



3\. You should see 2x XBOX 360 controllers like the image below shows. If you do not, keep this "Game Controllers" window open and change the mode by following the instructions below.
### Change mode
Typically the Polycade AGS calibration screens will guide you through this process, but if for whatever reason that's not happening, you can try this method. Both the Player 1 and Player 2 controls on your Polycade's controller are seen by the computer as Xbox Controllers. It’s possible to change the mode of the controller by holding down the “Exit” button. This will cause the controls for that player to stop working.
In order to restore function, hold down the “Exit” button for about 10 seconds:
-------------------------------
46. What do all the buttons do?
-------------------------------
The buttons on the Polycade panel are mapped to the buttons you would find on an XBox controller. 
We also include a trackball and 3 smaller buttons near the trackball that can be used as a mouse. 
Below is a guide on how the button are laid out on the Polycade panel:
Polycade Panel Guide
-------------------------------
47. Keyboard shortcuts
-------------------------------
## Open Start Menu
Pressing the Windows key opens the Start menu. From here, you can use your trackball as a mouse to navigate out of Polycade AGS. 
## Switch Between Applications and Tabs
Alt+Tab is a very quick way to switch between running applications. If switching between more than two windows, you’ll have to hold the Alt key and press Tab repeatedly to toggle through the list of open windows.
## Close Tabs and Windows
To quickly close the current application, press Alt+F4. 
## Access the Task Manager
Ctrl+Alt+Delete will take you to a screen that allows you to quickly launch the Task Manager or perform other operations, such as signing out.
This is particularly useful because it can be used to recover from situations where your computer doesn’t appear responsive or isn’t accepting input. For example, if a full-screen game becomes unresponsive, Ctrl+Alt+Delete will often allow you to escape from it and end it via the Task Manager.
## Fullscreen a game
When a game opens in a small window, press Alt+Enter on your keyboard. This should fullscreen the game. 
-------------------------------
48. Gameplay controls
-------------------------------
## Joystick
Use the **Joystick** to navigate to the game you want to play
## Green
Use the Green button to **Select** a game. The Green button also acts as the main Select button in most modern games:
## Red
Use the Red button to go **Back** while in game or while in most menus:
## Start
Use the **Start** button to start classic/retro games
## Option
Use the option button to add Coins/Credits in classic arcade games. It also acts as the NES _select_ button.
## Exit
When in game, use the **Exit** button to pause and view game Instructions or Exit a game.

53. Removing the "Control Panel"
-------------------------------
In order to remove the control panel on your Polycade, follow these steps:
  
1\. Open the drawer on your Polycade 
2\. Unscrew the 2 thumbscrews located approximately 4-5 inches from the outsides of the panel. NOTES:
  * These feel like little metal knobs that are meant for your fingers. If you find the rubber bumpers with a screw in the middle, you're too far back.
  * If you have a v2 Polycade (v2's have a metal cabinet and no camera above the screen), then there may be 2 additional thumbscrews 6" back from the front two (parallel with the front two. These will be tricky to reach. We recommend unscrewing the back left one first, followed by the back right one, then the front two, as removing each one can make the next one harder to remove. 

On the v2 and v3, the front thumbscrews can be by sliding out the drawer:| On the v4, you will need to open the access panel on the front of the machine and then locate the thumbscrews in the location shown below  
---|---

61. Installing a dimmer
-------------------------------
**NOTE: This is a power related hardware modification; you do this at your own risk and Polycade Inc. is not responsible for any issues that arise out of these instructions. These modifications are not covered under product warranties.**
  1. Purchase an LED dimmer like [this one.](https://www.amazon.com/SUPERNIGHT-12V-24V-Controller-Brightness-Aluminum/dp/B07HN1BJWK)
  2. Turn off your Polycade.
  3. [Remove your button panel](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/2975/article/13006).
  4. Install the LED dimmer in the back of your drawer. We used double sided tape to stick it down.
  5. Find the black and yellow cables for the logo LEDs, they will be running vertically in the middle, connecting the logo LEDs with the power supply. This cable should have a fair amount of slack that might be wrapped with a tie-wrap or similar. We will be cutting this black and yellow cable once we can determine where it should be cut.
  6. With the drawer fully open, figure out where you will need to cut the cable in order to reach the LED dimmer when the drawer is fully open. Cut the black and yellow cables accordingly.
  7. Strip the freshly cut ends, exposing the metal fibers inside.
  8. Refering to the image below for positions, insert the cables into your dimmer and tighten them down with a screwdriver. 


-------------------------------
62. Disabling Startup Programs
-------------------------------
## 
Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 make it really simple to disable startup applications. All you have to do is open up Task Manager by right-clicking on the Taskbar, or using the CTRL + SHIFT + ESC shortcut key, clicking “More Details,” switching to the Startup tab, and then using the Disable button.
It’s really that simple. If you aren’t seeing these options, make sure to click “More Details,” which is in the same place as the “Fewer details” that you see on this screenshot.

64. How do I connect to Wi-Fi?
-------------------------------
First, you will need access to a keyboard. This will require opening the control panel, instructions for that process can be found here: https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/2975/article/13006
Many Polycade machines ship with a USB keyboard inside, if you find that your machine does not have one you will need to locate one and plug it in.
Depending on how up-to-date your version of Polycade AGS is, you may be able to log into Wi-Fi entirely through our software. To do this, follow these steps:
  1. From your home screen, press the Esc key
  2. Move down to "Network"
  3. Select "Open WiFi Settings"
  4. Click "Show available networks"
  5. Your machine's network settings will open- find the Wi-Fi network you wish to use and select it
  6. If necessary, enter the password
  7. Close the Settings window


If you are unable to connect via AGS's built-in network settings for any reason, you can accomplish the same end via Windows with these steps:
  1. Press Control + Alt + Delete
  2. When you see the menu that has options for Lock, Switch User, Sign Out and Task manager, look in the bottom right corner for 3 icons
  3. Select the Globe icon, this should be the left most of the 3
  4. Your machine's network settings will open- find the Wi-Fi network you wish to use and select it
  5. If necessary, enter the password
  6. Once connected, click anywhere outside the network options to close the box
  7. Select "Cancel" to return to your previous screen


You should only need to connect once but if you ever desire to change networks, simply follow the steps above and choose a different network option.

65. New Polycade machine setup instructions
-------------------------------
If you've just received your Polycade and it requires setup, there are a few simple steps to get you up and running. Much of this article will require access to a keyboard which comes with your Polycade, [a guide on how to access the keyboard can be found here. ](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/2975/article/13006)Also, note that the trackball in the center of your control panel can be used as a mouse with the lower left button being the standard "left-click" while the lower right button is "right-click,"
  1. [Connect to Wi-Fi](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/4100/article/19222)
  2. Set Polycade AGS to Launch on Windows Startup. To do this, you need to open your Settings screen on AGS by heading to the AGS home screen pressing Esc, then navigating to General and scrolling down to Launch on Windows Startup - make sure it is toggled "On."
  3. Disable most startup items (Press ctrl+shift+esc, open the startup tab and disable Startup Applications like Steam, Xbox App services, anything that is non-essential aside from Polycade AGS)
  4. Ensure that Polycade AGS checks for updates (and installs them if necessary), this will happen at start-up so restarting the AGS program or rebooting your machine should prompt the update check.
  5. You're now ready to [add games to your machine!](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/2973/article/11911)


If for any reason Polycade AGS isn't on your machine,[ it can be re-downloaded here.](https://polycade.com/pages/download-polycade-ags) Of course, make sure you're connected to the internet first!
-------------------------------
66. Disable Windows Sign-in Button
-------------------------------
You may occasionally see a Sign-in screen that requires a mouse to click the "Sign-in" button. 
If you'd like to remove this, follow these steps:
  1. Press the WINDOWS LOGO KEY on your keyboard (to the left of the spacebar). Type 'cmd'
  2. Using your mouse, click on "Run as administrator"  



3\. In the following screen, choose "Yes"
4\. Type the following into the command prompt:  
powercfg /SETDCVALUEINDEX SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_NONE CONSOLELOCK 0
Then press ENTER.
5\. Type the following into the command prompt (there's only 1 letter difference from the previous command):
powercfg /SETACVALUEINDEX SCHEME_CURRENT SUB_NONE CONSOLELOCK 0
Then press ENTER.
  
6\. Reboot your computer. You shouldn't see the sign-in screen again.
-------------------------------
67. My sound isn't working
-------------------------------
Here are a few steps you can try if your sound is not working.
  1. Make sure your sound isn't muted by Windows. Press the Windows key to view the task bar, on the bottom right of your screen next to the date and time will be a volume icon. Click this icon and ensure that your sound isn't muted and is turned up to a reasonable volume
  2. The physical volume dial on your Polycade machine can be turned up and down, sometimes this is turned all the way down by mistake. This dial will be in different places depending on which version of Polycade you own. For most versions it will be in the drawer on the left side, if it is not there, it may be to the left of the logo on the from of your machine. Once you locate this dial, turn it up to a reasonable volume.
  3. Check that the audio cable is plugged in. You will need to remove the button panel ( see this article for a guide on how to do that - <https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/2975/article/13006>) then completely open the drawer. Once this is done you can see the actual computer itself with cables plugged into the top. Make sure that the audio cable is not disconnected or loose. 


-------------------------------
68. Polycade Won't Power On
-------------------------------
If your Polycade won't turn on, follow this guide to fix it.
  
Before we begin, let's confirm your issue is power related and not a "black screen" issue. What's the difference? If your Polycade logo turns on, but the screen remains black (or the screen turns on for a moment followed by black), then you have a different issue. Refer to [this other guide](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/4548/article/21254) for the black screen issue. 
If your Polycade logo does not turn on, follow these steps (listed in order of best troubleshooting procedure) to identify & fix the issue.
  1. Did you try pressing the power button? It's a bit hidden, so we get this a lot. Once you plug in your Polycade, you need to press the power button that is on the underside of the machine, in the middle. Can't find it? If you lay down on the floor and look up, you'll see the power button on the bottom of the Polycade. Press it once and the machine should power on.
  2. Have you verified the wall outlet works? Try plugging a lamp into it and make sure the outlet is functional.
  3. It's possible the power button cable got unplugged on the inside of the machine. [Follow this great guide from community member RallyGunz to fix this issue](https://forums.polycade.com/d/128-entire-polycade-not-starting-from-power-button). Need help getting inside your Polycade? If you have a model where the front opens (or the back door if it's a Squadcade or Retro), the inside should be easy to access (on the Lux model, the cables that keep the front from opening completely can be detached at the top by moving them through the little maze channels). If not, [follow these instructions to get inside your machine](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/4548/article/21255). If you have a v1 Polycade (wooden cabinet), you'll need to [take it off the wall and pull the back off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSZgn1paxqw&t=235s).
  4. If your Polycade still does not turn on, on the inside of the machine find the computer's PSU (power supply unit), which looks like a black cube and has a standard power cable plugged into it. There is a power switch nearby where the power cable plugs in. Make sure the "I" is down and the "O" is up, then try pressing the power button on the bottom of the machine again.
  5. Make sure the power cable that plugs into the PSU is fully inserted into the PSU.
  6. Inside the Polycade you will find a power strip (usually located near the bottom on one side). Make sure the power button on the power strip is set to ON. There will be a green light nearby the power button to indicate it is on.
  7. It's possible the power strip has died. Get another power strip and test it by plugging it in and plugging a lamp or similar device into it to make sure it works. Then, unplug everything in the power strip inside the Polycade, and plug it into the working power strip (make sure the working power strip is plugged into an outlet). Now, try pressing the Polycade power button on the bottom of the machine again.

69. Black screen after powering on
-------------------------------
If you turn on your Polycade and the logo light turns on, but the screen remains black, follow these steps to fix or diagnose the issue:
  1. When you turned on the Polycade, did the screen turn on for a brief moment? If the screen did not turn on, then it's likely you have an issue with the screen, not the computer. Refer to [this other guide](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/4548/article/21257) to troubleshoot your screen.
  2. Sometimes connections can get "flaky", especially during shipping. First, you'll need to [get inside your Polycade](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/4548/article/21255) to inspect the computer. Before you touch any of the computer parts, make sure you discharge any static electricity you may have in your body by touching a large piece of metal (if you have a Lux model Polycade, the cabinet is great for this). Next, remove the RAM and then plug it back into the same place.
  3. From here on out, this issue is considered an advanced computer problem, and can be difficult to troubleshoot. You may want to hire a local PC computer tech to review and fix this issue, as the Polycade uses a regular Windows PC, which any computer technician should be able to fix. You can even remove the computer from the Polycade (to bring it into a shop) by unplugging all of the cables and removing the 4 nuts at the edge of the internal PC chassis. If you want to troubleshoot this yourself, there are 3 key issues that can cause this problem:
    1. The RAM has gone bad. Get a new stick of RAM and swap it for the old one.
    2. There is an issue with the CPU. Maybe unplugging the CPU and plugging it back in will help, otherwise you might have to replace the CPU.
    3. There is an issue with the motherboard. You may need a new motherboard - make sure the one you choose is compatible with your CPU.

70. How to open your Polycade
-------------------------------
If you have a model where the front opens (or the back door if it's a Squadcade or Retro), the inside should be easy to access (on the Lux model, the cables that keep the front from opening completely can be detached at the top by moving them through the little maze channels). 
If not, follow [these instructions to get inside your machine](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/2975/article/13006). If you need better access to the inside of the machine, take it off the wall and remove the back panel (often attached with velcro).
If you have a v1 Polycade (wooden cabinet), you'll need to [take it off the wall and pull the back off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSZgn1paxqw&t=235s).

71. Screen does not turn on
-------------------------------
When you turn on the Polycade, did the screen turn on for a brief moment? If so, the screen is working an you may have an issue with the computer. Refer to [this other guide](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/4548/article/21254) to troubleshoot your computer.
  1. Make sure the screen itself is turned on. In most cases, you'll need to [take the Polycade off the wall](https://polycade.com/pages/helphq-2#/collection/4548/article/21255) to check this. Once you open the back of the Polycade, make sure the machine is turned on. Then, find the power button on the monitor - it's located at the bottom left corner (when looking at the back of the monitor), and (depending on the model), is either a square button on the back, or a button on the bottom of the monitor. For either model, the power button is the one closest to the corner. Press it once to turn it on.
  2. Make sure the monitor power cable is connected at both ends. Sometimes it helps to unplug and plug back in both ends. Repeat step 1 to make sure the monitor is on.
  3. Try plugging the monitor power cable into a different outlet. If your power strip has different colored outlets, plug it into a RED one. Repeat step 1 to make sure the monitor is on.
  4. If you try all of the above and the screen still won't power on, it's likely that your screen has died. This is super rare (we've only seen it happen once at the time of this writing), but everything dies eventually! Reach out to support@polycade.com for a recommended replacement.
